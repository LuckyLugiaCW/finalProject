ACOUSTIC MODELER

Allows the user to import sound files and displays information about its waveform, frequencies, and resonance. If you want to observe how different properties of sound interact, this is your module.

----------

BUTTONS

IMPORT - Opens a prompt that allows the user to select a file. Currently, only wav and mp3 files are accepted.

LOW/MID/HIGH - Changes the RT60 graph between low (~200 Hz), mid (~1000 Hz), and high (~5000 Hz) frequencies.

SPLIT/MERGED - Changes whether the RT60 graphs display seperately or together.

----------

OTHER INFORMATION

WAVEFORM - Shows the amplitude of the audio over time.

SPECTROGRAM - Shows the intensity of different frequencies in the audio over time.

LENGTH - Length of the audio file in seconds.

RESONANCE - Frequency of the highest amplitude in Hertz.

DIFFERENCE (currently broken) - Difference between average RT60 and 0.5 seconds.
